        <div>
        <p class="white-text"> <center>Computer science involves the study of computers and their systems.<br>
            It mainly focuses on theories, designs, and software systems applications. Some of computer science's basics are drawn from engineering and mathematics.<br>
            As a result, methods from fields such as probability, statistics, and electronic circuit design are incorporated as part of the study.<br>
            Computer science major includes the study of artificial intelligence, computer, and network design, data structures, information technology, information processes, and algorithms. This major involves four other different computer disciplines. These disciplines are information technology,  computer engineering, information systems, and software engineering. The relationship between these disciplines and computer science is based on computing being their study object.
            In a world that is shifting from the traditional era to a modern era defined by computers and technology, computer science has become one of the most sought majors in colleges by students across the globe.<br>
            Computer science is offered in numerous colleges worldwide. A computer science major would help students understand how computers and computing systems work, improving their interactions with computers and their systems.<br>
            In college, computer science would be broken down into smaller units, making it easier for students to comprehend.<br>
            Upon completion of each unit, students would be required to undertake examinations to test their understanding.
           Those who pass the test would advance to the next unit, while those who fail would be required to retake the units. The study of computer science in colleges is not only theoretical but also practical. Practical lessons and examinations are also involved in enhancing the understanding of students. After completing all the units in computer science, major students graduate from college and advance their studies or look for work.
