                                Computer science is a major for problem solvers who want to learn how to use computers and computational processes to build websites, program robots, mine data and more. 
                                Computer science majors may go on to master’s or doctorate programs in the field, and they can work in research and industry. 
                                Students will gain experience with the theory and practice of computer science as they explore algorithms, programming languages and operating systems, for example. 
                                In classes, majors may apply their learning to topics like computational finance, robotics and network security. 
                                Undergraduates may also be able to access research opportunities.

                                Computer science majors must study calculus to earn their degrees, and other relevant math courses include statistics and linear algebra. 
                                Introductory computer science classes cover topics like algorithm design, computer organization and abstract data types. 
                                After students develop a strong foundation in the major, they can move on to more complicated courses related to data visualization, neural networks and cryptography, among other subjects. 
                                At some schools, students may choose to pursue either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science in computer science. 
                                The B.A. contains fewer required classes and may be more relevant for students who plan to work in another field after college. 
                                Many degree programs make it possible for students to combine computer science with another discipline, like architecture, electrical engineering or molecular biology. 
                                Students interested in research can seek out opportunities with faculty members, develop independent projects and look into relevant coursework.
